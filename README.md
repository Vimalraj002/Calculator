# Calculator Application - V-CALC

## Description
The **V-CALC** is a fully functional calculator web application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It features a sleek and responsive design and uses local storage to save the last entered expression for user convenience.

## Features
- Perform basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Displays the result instantly using an evaluation algorithm.
- Backspace button to delete the last entered character.
- Clear button to reset the display.
- Responsive design for better user experience.
- Local storage functionality to save the last entered expression and display it on page reload.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the application.
- **CSS3**: For styling the calculator.
- **JavaScript**: For functionality and logic implementation.

## Files
1. **index.html**: Contains the structure of the calculator, including input fields and buttons.
2. **style.css**: Provides styling for the calculator, ensuring it looks modern and user-friendly.
3. **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript logic for calculations, local storage, and button interactions.

## How to Run the Application
1. Download the files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
2. Place all the files in the same directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
4. Start using the calculator!

## Local Storage Functionality
- The app saves the last entered expression and its result in the browser's local storage.
- On page reload, the saved expression is displayed on the calculator screen.

## User Interface
- **Display**: Shows the entered numbers and results.
- **Buttons**: Includes digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), clear button (C), equals button (=), and backspace button (ðŸ ”).
- **Styling**: The calculator is styled with a black-and-green color theme, ensuring high contrast and readability.

## How It Works
1. **Append Value**: Each button click adds the respective value to the display.
2. **Clear Display**: Resets the input and clears local storage.
3. **Backspace**: Removes the last character from the input.
4. **Calculate**: Evaluates the entered expression using a custom algorithm.

## Screenshots
- Add screenshots of the calculator in action for better visualization (optional).

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for more advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square root, percentage, etc.).
- Implement a history feature to track previous calculations.
- Enhance responsiveness for smaller devices.
